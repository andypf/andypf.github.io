However, in creating them, we have made an effort to describe the most important aspects as simply and clearly as possible.<h2 class=adsimple-321201991>Google Fonts Privacy Policy</h2><p>On our website, we use Google Fonts, which are the "Google Fonts" provided by Google Inc. For the European region, the company responsible for all Google services is Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland).<p>Using Google Fonts does not require you to sign in or provide a password. Furthermore, no cookies are stored in your browser. The files (CSS, fonts) are requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, the requests for CSS and fonts are completely separate from all other Google services. If you have a Google account, you don't need to worry about your Google account data being transmitted to Google while using Google Fonts. Google records the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and the fonts used, and securely stores this data. We will take a closer look at the specifics of data storage.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>What are Google Fonts?</h3><p>Google Fonts (formerly Google Web Fonts) is a directory of over 800 fonts that <a class=adsimple-321201991 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC?tid=321201991">Google</a> provides to its users free of charge.<p>Many of these fonts are released under the SIL Open Font License, while others have been released under the Apache License. Both are open-source software licenses.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3><p>Google Fonts allows us to use fonts on our website without having to host them on our own server. It is a crucial component in maintaining the quality of our website. All Google Fonts are automatically optimized for the web, saving data and providing a significant advantage, especially for mobile devices. When you visit our site, the low file size ensures fast loading times. Additionally, Google Fonts are secure web fonts. Various rendering systems in different browsers, operating systems, and mobile devices can sometimes cause errors that distort text or entire web pages. Thanks to the rapid Content Delivery Network (CDN), there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. Google Fonts supports all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) and works reliably on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We use Google Fonts to present our entire online service as beautifully and consistently as possible.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>What data does Google store?</h3><p>When you visit our website, the fonts are loaded from a Google server. This external request results in data being transmitted to Google servers. Google recognizes that you or your IP address are visiting our website. The Google Fonts API is designed to minimize the usage, storage, and collection of end-user data to what is necessary for the proper provision of fonts. By the way, API stands for "Application Programming Interface" and serves, among other things, as a data transmitter in the software field.<p>Google Fonts securely stores CSS and font requests at Google, ensuring protection. Through the collected usage statistics, Google can determine how well each font is received. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Additionally, Google also uses data from its own web crawler to identify which websites use Google Fonts. This data is published in the BigQuery database of Google Fonts. Entrepreneurs and developers use Google's BigQuery web service to examine and manipulate large datasets.<p>However, it's important to note that with each Google Font request, information such as language settings, IP address, browser version, browser screen resolution, and browser name is automatically transmitted to Google servers. Whether this data is also stored is not clearly ascertainable and is not explicitly communicated by Google.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>How long and where are the data stored?</h3><p>Google stores requests for CSS assets on its servers for one day, primarily located outside the EU. This allows us to use fonts using a Google stylesheet. A stylesheet is a template that enables easy and quick changes to the design or font of a website.<p>Font files are stored at Google for one year. Google aims to fundamentally improve the loading time of websites. When millions of websites reference the same fonts, they are cached after the first visit and immediately appear on all other subsequently visited websites. Sometimes, Google updates font files to reduce file size, increase language coverage, and enhance design.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3><p>Data stored by Google for one day or one year cannot be easily deleted. The data is automatically transmitted to Google when the page is accessed. To delete this data prematurely, you need to contact Google Support at <a class=adsimple-321201991 href="https://support.google.com/?hl=en&amp;tid=321201991">https://support.google.com/?hl=en&amp;tid=321201991</a>. In this case, data storage can only be prevented by not visiting our site.<p>Unlike other web fonts, Google allows us unrestricted access to all fonts. Therefore, we can access an unlimited variety of fonts to optimize our website. For more information about Google Fonts and additional questions, you can visit <a class=adsimple-321201991 href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=321201991">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=321201991</a>. While Google addresses privacy-related matters, detailed information about data storage is not included. Obtaining precise information about stored data from Google is relatively challenging.<p>You can also read about the data collected by Google and its use on <a class=adsimple-321201991 href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;tid=321201991">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.<h2 class=adsimple-321201991>Google Analytics Privacy Policy</h2><p>We use the analytics tracking tool Google Analytics (GA) on our website, provided by the American company Google Inc. For the European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. Google Analytics collects data about your actions on our website. For instance, when you click on a link, this action is stored in a cookie and sent to Google Analytics. The reports we receive from Google Analytics help us better tailor our website and services to your preferences. Below, we delve into the details of the tracking tool and provide information on what data is stored and how you can prevent it.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>What is Google Analytics?</h3><p>Google Analytics is a tracking tool used for traffic analysis on our website. To enable Google Analytics, a tracking code is embedded in the code of our website. When you visit our website, this code records various actions you perform on our site. Once you leave our website, this data is sent to and stored on the Google Analytics servers.<p>Google processes the data, and we receive reports on your user behavior. These reports may include, among others:<ul class=adsimple-321201991><li class=adsimple-321201991>Audience reports: Through audience reports, we gain a better understanding of our users and know more about those interested in our services.<li class=adsimple-321201991>Ad reports: Ad reports make it easier for us to analyze and improve our online advertising.<li class=adsimple-321201991>Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide helpful information on how we can attract more people to our services.<li class=adsimple-321201991>Behavior reports: Here, we learn how you interact with our website. We can trace the path you take on our site and which links you click.<li class=adsimple-321201991>Conversion reports: A conversion refers to an action where you perform a desired action due to a marketing message. For example, if you go from a mere website visitor to a buyer or newsletter subscriber. Through these reports, we learn more about how our marketing efforts resonate with you, aiming to increase our conversion rate.<li class=adsimple-321201991>Real-time reports: Here, we instantly learn what is happening on our website. For example, we see how many users are currently reading this text.</ul><h3 class=adsimple-321201991>Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h3><p>Our goal with this website is clear: we want to provide you with the best possible service. The statistics and data from Google Analytics help us achieve this goal.<p>The statistically analyzed data give us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On one hand, we can optimize our site to be more easily found by interested people on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us understand you as a visitor better. We know exactly what we need to improve on our website to offer you the best possible service. The data also assist us in making our advertising and marketing efforts more individualized and cost-effective. Ultimately, it makes sense to showcase our products and services to people who are interested in them.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>What data does Google Analytics store?</h3><p>Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID associated with your browser cookie using a tracking code. This allows Google Analytics to recognize you as a new user. The next time you visit our site, you are identified as a "returning" user. All collected data is stored along with this user ID, making it possible to analyze pseudonymous user profiles.<p>Your interactions on our website are measured through identifications such as cookies and app instance IDs. Interactions include all types of actions you perform on our website. If you also use other Google systems (such as a Google account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked to third-party cookies. Google does not disclose Google Analytics data unless approved by us as website operators. Exceptions may occur if required by law.<p>The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:<p><strong class=adsimple-321201991>Name:</strong> __utma<br><strong class=adsimple-321201991>Value:</strong> 1564498958.1564498958.1564498958.1<br><strong class=adsimple-321201991>Purpose:</strong> This cookie allows tracking of your behavior on the website and measures performance. The cookie is updated every time information is sent to Google Analytics.<br><strong class=adsimple-321201991>Expiration:</strong> after 2 years<p><strong class=adsimple-321201991>Note:</strong> This list cannot claim to be exhaustive, as Google may change its choice of cookies from time to time.<p>Here we provide an overview of the key data collected with Google Analytics:<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>How long and where are the data stored?</h3><p>Google has servers distributed worldwide, with most located in America. Consequently, your data is mostly stored on American servers. You can find the exact locations of Google data centers here: <a class=adsimple-321201991 href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=de</a><p>Your data is distributed across various physical storage devices. This ensures faster data retrieval and better protection against manipulation. Each Google data center has contingency programs in place for your data. For example, in the event of hardware failure or natural disasters affecting servers, the risk of service interruption at Google remains low.<p>Google Analytics has a standard retention period of 26 months for your user data. After this period, your user data is deleted. However, we have the option to choose the retention period for usage data ourselves. We have five options available:<ul class=adsimple-321201991><li class=adsimple-321201991>Deletion after 14 months<li class=adsimple-321201991>Deletion after 26 months<li class=adsimple-321201991>Deletion after 38 months<li class=adsimple-321201991>Deletion after 50 months<li class=adsimple-321201991>No automatic deletion</ul><p>Once the specified period has expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to data associated with cookies, user identification, and advertising IDs (e.g., DoubleClick domain cookies). Report results are based on aggregated data and are stored independently of user data. Aggregated data involves merging individual data into a larger unit.<h3 class=adsimple-321201991>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3><p>According to the data protection laws of the European Union, you have the right to access, update, delete, or restrict your data. By using the browser add-on to disable Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), you can prevent Google Analytics from using your data.

This updates existing Google Analytics features (advertising reports, remarketing, cross-device reports, and reports on interests and demographic features) to obtain aggregated and anonymized data from you, provided you have allowed personalized ads in your Google account.<p>This involves cross-device tracking, allowing your data to be analyzed across devices. By activating Google Signals, data is collected and linked to your Google account. For example, Google can recognize if you view a product on our website with a smartphone and later purchase the product with a laptop. Thanks to the activation of Google Signals, we can launch cross-device remarketing campaigns that would not be possible otherwise. Remarketing means that we can show you our offer on other websites as well.<p>Google Signals in Google Analytics also captures additional visitor data such as location, search history, YouTube history, and data about your actions on our website. This helps us receive better advertising reports from Google and useful information about your interests and demographic features. These include your age, language, location, gender, occupation, marital status, and income. All these features help Google Analytics define groups or audiences.<p>The reports also help us better understand your behavior, desires, and interests. We can optimize and adapt our services and products for you based on this data. This data expires by default after 26 months. Please note that this data collection only occurs if you have allowed personalized advertising in your Google account. It always involves aggregated and anonymous data, never individual data. You can manage or delete this data in your Google account.<p style=margin-top:15px>Source: Created with the <a title="Privacy Policy Generator Germany" href=https://www.adsimple.de/datenschutz-generator/ target=_blank rel=follow style=text-decoration:none>Privacy Policy Generator</a> by AdSimple in cooperation with <a href=https://www.fashiongott.de target=_blank rel=follow>fashiongott.de</a></div></div><div class=row><a name=imprint></a><div class=side><h2 class=title>Imprint</h2></div><div class=main><p>Information obligation according to § 5 TMG.<p>Onlinemarketing Pfau<br>Waldkauzweg 37,<br>14974 Ludwigsfelde,<br>Germany<p><strong>Pfau Software</strong> is a brand of <strong>Onlinemarketing Pfau</strong>.<p><p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=mailto:contact@pfau-software.de>contact@pfau-software.de</a><p><strong>VAT ID:</strong> DE263725390<p><strong>Represented by the shareholders</strong><br>Andreas Pfau<p style=margin-top:15px>Source: Created with the <a title="Imprint Generator Germany" href=https://www.adsimple.de/impressum-generator/ target=_blank rel=follow style=text-decoration:none>Imprint Generator</a> by AdSimple in cooperation with <a href=https://www.bauenwir.de target=_blank rel=follow>bauenwir.de</a><h2>EU Dispute Resolution</h2><p>In accordance with the Regulation on Online Dispute Resolution in Consumer Affairs (ODR Regulation), we would like to inform you about the Online Dispute Resolution Platform (OS Platform).
